/* Structures and Functions
Goal
Learn how to pass structures to and return structures from functions and understand the trade-offs between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.

Activity
Write a function that takes a structure as a value argument and modifies it.
Write a function that takes a pointer to structure and modifies it.
Return a structure from a function and print its values.
Measure memory usage and performance difference between pass-by-value and reference.
Tip: Prefer passing by pointer in embedded systems for performance and memory efficiency.*/
